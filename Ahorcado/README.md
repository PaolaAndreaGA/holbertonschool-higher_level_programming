**Hangman**  is a  [paper and pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game "Paper-and-pencil game")  [guessing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guessing#Guessing_games "Guessing")  for two or more players. One player thinks of a  [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word"),  [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase "Phrase")  or  [sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics) "Sentence (linguistics)")  and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting  [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet) "Letter (alphabet)")  within a certain number of guesses.

## History[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by  [Alice Gomme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Gomme "Alice Gomme")  in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes.

[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)#cite_note-1)  This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.

## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Overview")]

The word to guess is represented by a row of  [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(punctuation) "Dash (punctuation)"), representing each  [letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet) "Letter (alphabet)")  of the  [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word"). In most variants,  [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun"), such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]  Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]  If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man  [stick figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_figure "Stick figure")  as a  [tally mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks "Tally marks").

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]  If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

## Variants[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Variants")]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Classroom_game_of_hangman.jpg/220px-Classroom_game_of_hangman.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Classroom_game_of_hangman.jpg)

A classroom game of Hangman

As the name of the game suggests, the  [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram "Diagram")  is designed to look like a  [hanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging "Hanging")  man. Although debates have arisen about the game,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)#cite_note-2)  it is still in use today. A common alternative for teachers is to draw an  [apple tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_tree "Apple tree")  with ten apples, erasing or crossing out the  [apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple "Apple")  as the guesses are used up.

The exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the  [gallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows "Gallows")  before play and draw parts of the man's body (traditionally the  [head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head "Head"), then the  [torso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso "Torso"), then the  [arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm "Arm")  and  [legs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg "Leg")  one by one). Some players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual elements of the gallows as part of the game, effectively giving the guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players include a  [face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face "Face")  on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time. Some players include beheading the head as the last chance by drawing a line at the neck.

Some modifications to game play ([house rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_rule "House rule")) to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting guesses on high-frequency  [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")  and  [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"). Another alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to facilitate the learning of a  [foreign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_language "Foreign language").

## Strategy[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Strategy")]

The fact that the twelve most commonly occurring letters in the  [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")  are  [e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu "Etaoin shrdlu")  (from most to least), along with other  [letter-frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency "Letter frequency")  lists, are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess. On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word that deliberately avoids common letters (e.g.  _rhythm_  or  _zephyr_) or one that contains rare letters (e.g.  _jazz_).

Another common strategy is to guess vowels first, as  [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")  only has five vowels ([a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A "A"),  [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E "E"),  [i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I "I"),  [o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O "O"), and  [u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U "U"), while  [y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y "Y")  may sometimes, but rarely, be used as a vowel) and  [almost every word has at least one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_words_without_vowels "English words without vowels").

According to a 2010 study conducted by Jon McLoone for  [Wolfram Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Research "Wolfram Research"), the most difficult words to guess include  _jazz_,  _buzz_,  _hajj_,  _faff_,  _fizz_,  _fuzz_  and variations of these.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)#cite_note-3)

## Derivations[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Derivations")]

The American game show  _[Wheel of Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show) "Wheel of Fortune (American game show)")_  was inspired by Hangman.  [Merv Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv_Griffin "Merv Griffin")  conceived of the show after recalling long car trips as a child, on which he and his sister played Hangman.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)#cite_note-4)

[Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil")  also had a show in the 1960s and again from s Play Hangman_, hosted by the legendary  [Silvio Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Santos "Silvio Santos"). Brazil would later get its own version of  _Wheel of Fortune_, running from 1980 to 1993, again from 2003 to 2012 (during which the new  _s Play Hangman_  aired), and again since 2013 to the present. These shows were also hosted by Santos.

In July 2017, the  [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC")  introduced a game show of its own called  _[Letterbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox_(game_show) "Letterbox (game show)")_, which is also based on Hangman.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)#cite_note-5)

## Example game[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangman_(game)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Example game")]

The following example game illustrates a player trying to guess the word  _hangman_  using a strategy based solely on letter frequency. As the player continues, a part of the stick figure on the noose is added. Once a full body is drawn, the game is over, and the player lost.
